# Fortinet FortiOS CLI references

## Review baseline and limits

- Vendor: Fortinet.
- Product and document title: FortiGate / FortiOS CLI Reference, CLI troubleshooting material, and Administration Guide.
- Reviewed versions: FortiOS 7.6.x and 8.0.0. The 7.6.x evidence set contains vendor pages for 7.6.0, 7.6.3, and 7.6.4; the 8.0 evidence is for 8.0.0.
- Verification date: 2026-09-09.
- Catalog module: `src/netops_helper/query_catalog/fortinet.py`.

The exact machine-checked templates and per-query source links are in the [generated query catalog](../query-catalog.md); the source-ID records are in [`query-sources.json`](../query-sources.json).

These references establish vendor-documented command syntax and operational purpose. They are not proof that a particular appliance, VDOM, administrator profile, or firmware build permits the command. They also do not prove the bytes emitted by an SSH library during session setup or cleanup. Enrollment still requires a read-only account, the FortiOS output-mode safety prerequisite, per-target query opt-in, and live validation on the actual model and firmware.

All returned data is sensitive operational evidence. It can expose serial numbers, interface and peer names, addresses, routes, MAC addresses, topology, HA history, and VPN state. It remains untrusted device output even when the command is read-only.

## Accepted Phase-1 queries

The table is the conservative Phase-1 whitelist. A template slot is accepted only from matching enrolled inventory. `high-volume` follows the generated catalogue definition: it is a scheduling advisory for variable collections or histories that can require continuation, and changes no authorization or runtime limit. `normal` is not a bounded-output promise.

### Version, model, and feature constraints

- Hardware memory, disk, and NIC output varies by FortiGate model, ASIC, interface type, and VM versus appliance form factor. A documented command can legitimately return unsupported or reduced output.
- HA, SD-WAN, IPsec, BGP, OSPF, BFD, IPv6, LLDP, and software-switch queries are useful only when the corresponding feature is available and configured. They should not be enabled merely because the platform is FortiOS.
- VDOM context can change visibility and output. The target account and expected VDOM context must be tested without granting configuration privileges.
- `bridge_mac_table` requires an exact enrolled software-switch name. `interface_details` and `interface_hardware` require an exact enrolled interface name.
- Fortinet can change output shape between maintenance releases. Consumers must treat output as untrusted text rather than a stable machine API.

## Explicitly excluded

These exclusions are capability boundaries, not merely undocumented omissions.

| Excluded class | Examples or former candidate | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full or partial configuration | top-level `show`, `show full-configuration`, startup/running/full configuration, configuration backup/export | Configuration can contain credentials, key material, topology, and policy details. Phase 1 intentionally has no configuration-reading capability. |
| Support and bulk collection | TAC/support reports, support bundles, bulk diagnostic reports, full routing databases beyond the accepted explicit routing table | They aggregate excessive and potentially secret-bearing data and can impose material CPU, storage, or output load. |
| Debugging and capture | `diagnose debug ...`, debug enable/filter commands, packet sniffers/capture, monitor or unbounded log dump | Debug state can persist or alter runtime behavior; packet and log output is highly sensitive and potentially unbounded. |
| Mutation or lifecycle control | `config`, `edit`, `set`, `unset`, `delete`, backup, test, restart, reset, clear, kill, reboot, or shutdown operations | These can change persistent configuration or live state. |
| Detailed IKE or tunnel listings | `diagnose vpn ike gateway list`, `diagnose vpn tunnel list`, and similarly detailed keying-state dumps | Detailed output can expose sensitive IKE/IPsec keying material and peer state. The bounded `ipsec_summary` and aggregate `ipsec_status` are the Phase-1 boundary. |
| VDOM enumeration | former `vd_list` candidate | It expands administrative topology exposure and is not needed for the current target-scoped troubleshooting contract. |
| Device log retrieval | arbitrary event, traffic, security, or system log commands | No arbitrary device log scope, filter, time bound, or safe output contract exists in Phase 1. |

## Deferred: live-test-only candidates

No additional command in this review is approved merely because it appears in vendor documentation. These gaps remain outside the whitelist until exact cross-version syntax, bounded output, read-only AAA behavior, and actual SSH wire behavior are tested:

- an IPv6 equivalent of the typed single-address route lookup;
- model-portable optics and environmental sensor detail beyond the accepted NIC, disk, and memory queries;
- scoped ARP, IPv6-neighbor, and bridge/FDB variants whose interface, VDOM, or software-switch semantics differ across releases;
- any command that requires an output modifier, interactive paging response, or feature-specific prompt.

These are research candidates, not callable query names. The accepted table must not be expanded from this section without a separate source and live-test review.

## Primary source manifest

Only first-party Fortinet pages are retained. General CLI references establish the reviewed baselines; focused pages support the mapped query groups and operational interpretation. No long vendor passages are copied.
