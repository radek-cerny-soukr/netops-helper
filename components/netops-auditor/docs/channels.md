# Collection channels

The auditor reads a device configuration through exactly one channel per device. The channel is
pinned in the inventory (`channel`), together with the fingerprint that channel needs
(`tls_fingerprint` for `fortios-rest`, `host_key_fingerprint` for `ssh`). There is no fallback
ladder: if the chosen channel fails, the collection fails and says why. Choosing a channel is the
operator's decision, so this page describes what each channel does and - more importantly - what it
does not do and what that costs.

Both device channels share the same rules:

- the answer is never logged; a `ChannelEvent` carries the request, the sha256 and the length of
  the raw answer,
- every command sent to a device is one `ChannelEvent`, with the request written down verbatim,
- the credential never appears in the request, in the audit trail, in a `repr` or in an error text,
- the peer is verified before the credential is sent,
- the timeout is mandatory and finite,
- the transport is injectable, so the test suite never touches the network,
- the auditor never changes a device. Not a policy, not an interface, not even a console setting.

## Channel `fortios-rest`

### What it does

- Sends `POST https://<host>/api/v2/monitor/system/config/backup?scope=global` and takes the answer
  as the configuration text. The API token travels in the `Authorization: Bearer` header, never in
  the URL: a token in a query string ends up in the device log and in every proxy log on the way.
- Verifies TLS on every call. There is no `verify=False`. Two paths are supported: a certificate
  valid against the system CA store, or a pin on the sha256 fingerprint of the device certificate
  from the inventory. With a pin the fingerprint is compared before the request is sent, so a
  mismatch drops the connection with the token unused.
- Default timeout 30 s, applied to the connection and to reading the answer.

### What it does not do, and what it costs

- **The export is not byte-stable.** Every PEM envelope of a private key is salted on its own, so
  two exports of an untouched device differ by hundreds of lines (~574 lines measured). A diff of
  findings over an unchanged device is therefore not empty unless those blocks are ignored.
- **The export carries private key material** (22 occurrences of `set private-key` measured), so
  more secrets pass through the tool than an audit needs.
- **The content depends on the access profile of the API user, not on the protocol.** With the
  `api_migration_rw` profile the answer misses the `super_admin` scope (the built-in `admin` account
  is absent). With the `super_admin` profile the same endpoint returned a superset of the CLI dump
  (17,323 lines against 16,115). A weaker profile gives a quietly incomplete picture.
- **The method does not separate reading from writing.** The backup endpoint is a `POST`, and the
  `/api/v2/cmdb/` branch can write. The boundary between read and write is the profile of the token,
  not the HTTP verb.
- Devices usually carry a self-signed certificate, so without a pinned fingerprint in the inventory
  there is nothing to verify the peer against.
- Only the `monitor/.../config/backup` endpoint is used. The `/api/v2/cmdb/` branch, which returns
  the configuration as JSON and would need no parser at all, is not used here.
- FortiOS only. There is no REST channel for any other platform.

### Tested against

**Not verified against a real device with this code.** The numbers above were measured with a
different tool; this collector has never talked to a FortiGate. Treat the REST channel as untested
until someone runs it against a device and writes the result here.

## Channel `ssh`

### What it does

- Runs OpenSSH as a subprocess (no paramiko, no netmiko), sends the commands of its platform and
  takes the answer of the last one as the configuration text.
- Takes the commands from a table, one entry per platform, not from a chain of conditions:

  | platform | first command | what it is for | second command |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `fortios` | `get system console` | read-only check, must answer `output ... standard` | `show` |
  | `exos` | `disable cli paging` | session setting, allowed to be sent | `show configuration` |

- Cleans the device prompt out of the answer, as part of the platform adapter, not of the
  transport - see below.
- Configures the client from arguments only, never from a system or user configuration file:
  `-F /dev/null`, `BatchMode=yes`, `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`, `IdentitiesOnly=yes`,
  `ClearAllForwardings=yes`, `ProxyCommand=none`, `PermitLocalCommand=no`, `ControlMaster=no`,
  `ControlPath=none`. `ssh` is a binary that can start other processes, so it is kept on a short
  leash. The child gets a minimal environment (`PATH`, `HOME`, `LC_ALL`) with no agent socket.
- Verifies the host key against `host_key_fingerprint` from the inventory: the key is read with
  `ssh-keyscan`, its sha256 fingerprint is computed and compared with the pin, and only the matching
  key is written into a throwaway `known_hosts` that the session then uses with
  `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`. There is no trust on first use.
- Never puts the credential in `argv`, where `ps` would show it to every user on the machine. The
  private key is written into a file with mode 0600 in a private temporary directory, passed as
  `-i <path>`, and the directory is removed when the call ends, on every path.
- Default timeout 120 s per command, about fifteen times the slowest dump measured (7.7 s). A
  collection runs at most three commands, so the wall clock is bounded by three timeouts.

### Why `show` and not `show full-configuration`

The two commands are not the same dump with a different level of detail. Measured on a FortiGate 80F
(FortiOS v8.0.0 build0167):

| | `show` | `show full-configuration` |
|---|---|---|
| lines | 20,521 | 57,258 |
| `config` sections | 2,163 | 2,525 |
| `set private-key` | **0** | **22** |
| `set certificate` | **0** | **14** |

`show full-configuration` writes out the default values as well - that is where the extra 36 thousand
lines come from - but it also writes out **private key material**. Taking it would throw away exactly
the property this channel was chosen for: the smallest possible amount of secrets inside the tool.
`show` has neither the defaults nor the keys, and it is the shape the current rules are tuned on.
So the auditor asks for `show`.

### The pager, and why it is not one universal command

Both platforms page long output, and that is where they differ in a way the tool has to respect:

- **FortiOS**: turning the pager off means `config system console` / `set output standard`, which is
  **a write into the device configuration**. The auditor must not do that, so it only asks
  `get system console` and reads `output`. Anything other than `standard` and the collection is
  refused with a message that says what to set. The auditor would rather not run than change a
  device for its own convenience.
- **EXOS**: `disable cli paging` is **a property of the session, not of the configuration** -
  verified on the switch, where `show configuration | include "paging"` returns nothing after it was
  sent. So the auditor is allowed to send it, and does.

One universal "turn the pager off" command would have to be a write on FortiOS. That is the reason
the commands live in a per-platform table.

### A one-shot command needs no PTY

FortiOS answers a command passed to `ssh` as a remote command, with no terminal allocated. Verified
with the native client and key authentication against FortiOS v8.0.0 build0167:

- `ssh -F /dev/null -o BatchMode=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=yes -o UserKnownHostsFile=... -o
  IdentitiesOnly=yes -i <key> <login>@<device> "get system status | grep Version"` - exit 0, 0.9 s,
  correct output, no PTY.
- the same invocation with `show full-configuration` - exit 0, 7.7 s, 57,258 lines, `config` 2,525 =
  `end` 2,525, so the dump is complete.

No `--More--` appears anywhere in the output (the only occurrence of the string "More" is the name of
an IPS signature, `Automationdirect.C-More`), and no CRLF comes from the session - the two lines that
carry `\r` hold a multi-line value from inside the configuration itself. The byte stream stays clean,
which is what the stability of this channel rests on, so this collector allocates no PTY (`-tt` is
not among the bound options).

What does need a PTY is the `ssh-manager` wrapper used elsewhere in this homelab, because it wraps
the command in `timeout N sh -c '...'`. That is a property of the wrapper, not of FortiOS.

### The prompt in the output, and the two hashes

A FortiOS device answers a one-shot command with its prompt printed into the output. Measured on the
FortiGate 80F, `cat -A`, `$` marks the end of a line:

```
FortiGate-80F # output              : standard $
login               : enable $
fortiexplorer       : enable $
$
FortiGate-80F #
```

The prompt is **glued to the first line** and hangs at the end as a line of its own. The
configuration dump has it too:

```
first line:   FortiGate-80F # #config-version=FGT80F-8.0.0-FW-build0167-260420:opmode=...
last line:    FortiGate-80F #
```

Left alone, this breaks two things: the preflight never finds its field (the key on the first line
reads `FortiGate-80F # output`, not `output`), and the snapshot carries the hostname of the device
and a prompt instead of being only the configuration.

So the platform adapter cleans it, by a rule that is deliberately narrow:

- **only the first line** can lose a prefix, and only when that line starts with a prompt shape: at
  least one character that is not `#`, then `"# "`. A first line that begins with `#` - such as
  `#config-version=...` - is therefore never touched.
- **only trailing lines** can be dropped, and only when they are exactly the same prompt that was
  found on the first line. If the first line carried no prompt, nothing is dropped at the end.
- **the middle is never touched at all.** A `#` inside a value (`edit "net # 42"`, a comment line,
  even `set alias "FortiGate-80F #"`) survives byte for byte, because the cleaner never looks there.

That is why the rule is anchored on the prompt found at the beginning rather than on "a hash
somewhere": a configuration line that happens to contain `#` must not be at risk, and here it cannot
be by construction.

**Two hashes, on purpose.** `ChannelEvent.response_sha256` and `response_bytes` describe the **raw
answer** - what really came back over the channel, prompt and all. That is the trace of the channel
and it has to stay honest. `Snapshot.sha256` and `size_bytes` describe the **cleaned text**, which is
what the auditor evaluates and stores. So **the hash of a snapshot is not the hash of the raw
answer**, and on a device that prints a prompt the two differ. If you compare a snapshot hash against
a dump you took by hand, compare it against the cleaned text, not against the raw session output.
When the device prints no prompt the cleaner does nothing and both hashes are equal.

### What it does not do, and what it costs

- **The configuration of a FortiGate cannot be restored from it.** `show` carries no certificate and
  no private key material (0 occurrences of either, see the table above). That is an advantage for
  an audit and a disqualification for a backup.
- **The content depends on the profile of the account that logs in.** A weaker profile returns a
  quietly incomplete view, and the counts of `config` and `end` still match, so nothing looks wrong.
- **EXOS can be collected, but not yet evaluated.** The auditor knows how to pull an EXOS
  configuration and store the snapshot; there are no rules for EXOS. Do not read `platform: exos` in
  the inventory as "EXOS is supported" - it is a snapshot, not an audit.
- **Unverified:** the behaviour when FortiOS reports `output: more`. Switching a production device
  to the pager would have been a write, so the refusal path was proven in tests, not on a device.
- **Unverified:** whether an EXOS switch prints its prompt into a one-shot answer the way FortiOS
  does. The same cleaning is declared for `exos` in the step table, and it is a no-op when no
  prompt is there, so it is safe either way - but it has not been measured against a switch. It
  could not be measured from here: the `ssh-manager` wrapper allocates a PTY, which is precisely
  the case this question is not about.

### What it gives you for free

The configuration of a FortiSwitch and of a FortiAP managed over FortiLink is part of the FortiGate
configuration (29 `edit` entries under `switch-controller managed-switch` and one
`wireless-controller wtp` on the lab 60F). One dump therefore covers the whole Fabric, and the
auditor does not have to visit the switch and the access point separately.

A pipe works: `show full-configuration | grep -c "^config"` walks the whole output, so long output
can be processed on the device side.

### Why OpenSSH as a subprocess and not a library

`paramiko` does not connect to the Extreme switches in this fleet at all: it ends with
`IncompatiblePeer` because of the old host key algorithm they offer, while the system `ssh` connects
without a complaint. That is a real case from production, not a preference. The system client also
brings its own host key handling, its own algorithm negotiation and its own maintenance, and the
auditor binds it with arguments instead of trusting a configuration file.

### Tested against

All measurements are from 12 September 2026 and were read-only; nothing was changed on any device.

| device | software | pager preflight | configuration dump | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FortiGate 60F (lab) | FortiOS v8.0.0 build0167 (GA.F) | `get system console` -> `output: standard` | `show full-configuration` - 2,421 sections, 3.9 s | FortiSwitch behind it (29 x `edit` in `switch-controller managed-switch`) and a FortiAP (1 x `wireless-controller wtp`) |
| FortiGate 80F (production) | FortiOS v8.0.0 build0167 (GA.F) | `output: standard` | `show` - 20,521 lines, 2,163 sections, no keys; `show full-configuration` - 57,258 lines, 2,525 sections, 6.6 s | no Fabric |
| Extreme X440-G2-12p SW2 | ExtremeXOS 33.7.1.6 | `disable cli paging` | `show configuration` - 2.3 s | |
| Extreme X440-G2-12p SW3 | ExtremeXOS 33.7.1.6 | `disable cli paging` | `show configuration` - 1.7 s | |

Beyond the interactive sessions, the channel was also verified as a **one-shot run against the
FortiGate 80F**: a command handed to `ssh` with no PTY, key authentication, full dump in 7.7 s, with
`config` and `end` counts matching and clean output (no pager marker, no CRLF from the session).
That run is also where the prompt in the output was found - the first `collect` against real
hardware failed on it, which no mock would have shown.

On FortiOS two dumps in a row were byte identical, and nine days apart, with dozens of changes in
between, every `ENC` field still matched.

That table is the anchor: if the channel does not work for you, this is the hardware and the firmware
where the behaviour was observed.

## Channel `file`

Reads a configuration snapshot from a local file. No credential, no fingerprint, no network. It is
the channel for a dump that somebody else collected, and the only channel that says nothing about
the device being reachable or about the moment the configuration was true.

## Choosing a channel

- `fortios-rest` if you want the configuration in a machine-readable shape from the API, you accept
  that two exports of an untouched device differ, and you accept that private key material passes
  through the tool. Pin the certificate fingerprint, and remember that the completeness of the
  answer is decided by the profile of the token.
- `ssh` if you want a stable diff over an unchanged device and the smallest possible amount of
  secrets inside the tool, and you can live with a console that has to be set to standard output
  and with a dump that cannot restore the device. Pin the host key fingerprint. It is also the only
  channel for EXOS - which today means a stored snapshot, not an audit.
- `file` if the collection happens somewhere else entirely.

Neither remote channel is a fallback for the other. Pick one per device and pin it.
