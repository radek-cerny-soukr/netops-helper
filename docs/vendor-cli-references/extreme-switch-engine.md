# Extreme Networks Switch Engine CLI references

## Review baseline and limits

- Vendor: Extreme Networks.
- Product and document title: Switch Engine v33.7.1 Command References.
- Reviewed version: Switch Engine 33.7.1.
- Verification date: 2026-09-09.
- Catalog module: `src/netops_helper/query_catalog/extreme.py`.

The exact machine-checked templates and per-query source links are in the [generated query catalog](../query-catalog.md); the source-ID records are in [`query-sources.json`](../query-sources.json).

These first-party command-reference pages establish syntax and intended operational behavior. They are not proof that a particular switch model, software image, feature license, or read-only AAA role permits a command. They also do not prove the bytes emitted by Netmiko during session setup or disconnect. Each target therefore requires per-query opt-in and live validation with its actual model, image, and read-only account.

All output is sensitive, untrusted device data. Interface descriptions, topology, addresses, MAC tables, VLAN names, chassis identity, process state, and hardware inventory can disclose operational details.

## Accepted Phase-1 queries

The table is the conservative Phase-1 whitelist. A template slot is accepted only from matching enrolled inventory. `high-volume` follows the generated catalogue definition: it is a scheduling advisory for variable collections or histories that can require continuation, and changes no authorization or runtime limit. `normal` is not a bounded-output promise.

The fixed `no-refresh` token requests a one-shot display. It is part of the reviewed command template, not a caller-supplied argument and not a persistent configuration change.

### Source-backed port syntax decisions

The two global port queries are distinct bounded views, not aliases:

- `show ports no-refresh` follows the official `show ports {port_list | tag tag} {no-refresh | refresh}` grammar and returns a one-shot operational port summary.
- `show ports configuration no-refresh` follows the official `show ports {mgmt | port_list | tag tag} configuration {no-refresh | refresh}` grammar and returns a one-shot Layer 1 view of administrative state, link state, autonegotiation, configured and actual speed and duplex, flow control, load sharing, and media. It is not a complete configuration-reading command.

Every `{interface}` slot is exactly one enrolled physical-port token. The conservative accepted forms are:

- a non-zero decimal physical port on a standalone switch, for example `1`;
- a two-component `slot:port` token on a stack, or `port:channel` on a supported standalone channelized port, for example `1:1` or `49:4`;
- a configured standalone `slot/port` token, for example `1/47`;
- a three-component `slot:port:channel` token on a supported channelized stack port, for example `2:49:4`.

Each decimal component is canonical, non-zero, and bounded to three digits. Ranges, lists, `all`, tags, wildcards, whitespace, extra CLI tokens, mixed separators, and three-component slash forms are rejected. The official `configure system ports notation [slot:port | slot/port]` command documents the optional standalone notation only; that mutating command is not present in the Phase-1 catalog.

### Version, model, and feature constraints

- The documentation baseline is 33.7.1. A switch running another Switch Engine release must be reviewed against that release before these templates are assumed compatible.
- Temperature, fan, power, diagnostics, and transceiver output depends on chassis and port hardware. Unsupported components can produce empty or unsupported results without making the command mutating.
- IPv4/IPv6 routing, Neighbor Discovery, LLDP, VLAN, LAG/LACP, and STP queries depend on the corresponding features, protocols, and licenses being present and enabled.
- Port identifiers are model-, topology-, channelization-, and configured-notation-dependent. Every port-bearing template uses the exact `interfaces` inventory; callers cannot synthesize a port discovered in output.
- High-volume queries are `cpu_monitoring`, `processes`, `ports`, `ports_configuration`, `arp_table`, `arp_interface`, `ipv6_neighbors`, `mac_table`, `mac_interface`, `lldp_neighbors`, `vlan_summary`, `sharing`, `lacp`, and `stp_summary`. Prefer a normal scoped variant where one exists and answers the question; the scoped ARP and FDB collections remain high-volume because one port can still contain many entries.
- Output fields and table size are not a stable API contract. Consumers must handle the result as untrusted text.

## Explicitly excluded

| Excluded class | Examples | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full or general configuration reading or export | `show configuration`, saved configuration, backup/export/upload of configuration | Complete configuration can expose credentials, management settings, topology, and policy. Phase 1 intentionally has no complete configuration-reading capability; the fixed `show ports configuration no-refresh` table is only a bounded port-state view. |
| Support and bulk collection | `show tech-support`, support bundles, full diagnostic collections | These can aggregate configuration and logs, generate very large output, and add meaningful device load. |
| Logs, monitoring, and packet capture | `show log`, live monitor streams, packet capture, debug output | The output can be secret-bearing or unbounded, and no safe time/filter contract exists in Phase 1. |
| Debug and tracing | debug/trace enable, filter, or state-changing diagnostic commands | Debug state can persist and can affect performance or runtime behavior. |
| Mutation or lifecycle control | configure/create/delete/enable/disable, clear, reset, restart, reboot, test, save, or upload operations | These alter persistent configuration or live state and are outside the read-only server. |
| Free-form CLI | arbitrary `show` suffixes, output pipes, caller-provided refresh mode | A caller-controlled command defeats the named-template and typed-inventory boundary. |

## Deferred: live-test-only candidates

No command in this section is callable. It records useful gaps that need exact 33.7.1 syntax review plus live read-only AAA and wire testing before a future whitelist change.

- A scoped VLAN query is deferred. The vendor syntax accepts VLAN names, tags, and list-like forms; Phase 1 currently has no canonical `vlans` inventory type. Only the global `vlan_summary` is accepted.
- Stack-, fabric-, and chassis-specific detail is deferred because command availability and output differ by model and deployment mode.
- Additional dynamic-routing detail is deferred until each protocol command has a bounded summary form, feature/license constraints, and read-only behavior verified on supported hardware.
- Any command that enters a refresh loop, prompts interactively, or requires a session-wide display setting remains deferred even if its visible output is operational.

Vendor documentation alone is insufficient to move a candidate from this section into the accepted table.
